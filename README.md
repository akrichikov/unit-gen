# UnitEval

> Leveraging LLM benchmark/evaluation tools with fine-tuning data engineering specifically tailored for Unit Mesh tools
> such as AutoDev, Studio B3, and DevOps Genius. The brilliance lies in the UnitEval functionality, which automatically
> selects and evaluates code within real projects.

This repository designs evaluate the code quality of the AI code, which will use
with [AutoDev](https://github.com/unit-mesh/auto-dev) IDE plugins.
We use [Chocolate Factory](https://github.com/unit-mesh/chocolate-factory) to build the prompt engine.
